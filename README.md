# WDI_Project_1: Beat The Intro

# This Project was done in week 2/3 of the Web Development Immersive course that commenced on 28th September 2015.

#It was achieved in 3 days, and presented to the group on completion

# Project Idea: To create a game that tests the players music knowledge.  Players take it in turns to guess the song that is playing, recieving a point for every correct answer they give.

#The Code:

Basic site with three webpages (homepage, instructions page, and the Play Page)- each with separate html and CSS files

-A basic function that is executed on the click of the play icon button.  
-This function then runs the others in turn including:
-One to call a random song from a library of sounds in a separate folder
-One to play this song
-A for loop to enable myself to add an event listener on each one.  
-Alerts notify the player whether he/she is right or worng
-function to check for a winner
-and notify a player when he/she has won the game
-a function that implements this on a scoreboard
